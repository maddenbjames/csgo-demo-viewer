# CSGO-DEMO-VIEWER



A web application that allows players to watch their CS:GO match recordings and make overlay drawings collaboratively â€” great for amateur teams to review their strats and setups.

Currently supports the following maps:

 - de_dust2
 - de_mirage
 - de_inferno
 - de_overpass
 - de_train

Still a wip, so lots of bugs and missing features.
