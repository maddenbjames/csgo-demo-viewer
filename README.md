# CSGO-DEMO-VIEWER


A web application with a focus on allowing players to watch their CS:GO match recordings collaboratively â€” great for amateur teams to review their strats and setups. Built with Express/React with Socket.io.

Still a work in progress, currently working on:
  - Adding more features (i.e. adjustable viewing speed, player info, drawing over game, room management)
  - File authentication
  - Cover edge cases when parsing demo files
  - Flaring up the UI
